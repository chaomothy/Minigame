# Funny Cube
Game Design Workshop | Spring 2023

A game about a funny cube trying to avoid obstacles to not fall in a pit and die.

A & D (or Left Arrow & Right Arrow) to move left and right, W (or Up Arrow) to jump.

Use your movement to avoid the incoming obstacles and jump over hurdles.

This game uses a simple player controller in order to move the character around, as well as a spawn manager and a catalog of prefabs in order to send obstacles coming your way. A script to destroy the obstacles as to not overload the game is put in place, and this script will also destroy the player if they fall in the pit located behind them.
